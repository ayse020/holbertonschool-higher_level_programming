This project contains Python scripts demonstrating file input/output operations.

## Learning Objectives

- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the `with` statement
- What is JSON
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure

| `4-from_json_string.py` | Returns an object represented by a JSON string |
| `5-save_to_json_file.py` | Writes an object to a text file using JSON representation |
| `6-load_from_json_file.py` | Creates an object from a JSON file |
| `7-add_item.py` | Adds all arguments to a Python list and saves them to a file |
| `8-class_to_json.py` | Returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object |
| `9-student.py` | Defines a Student class with JSON serialization methods |
| `10-student.py` | Enhanced Student class with reload from JSON method |
| `11-student.py` | Student class with filtering attributes for JSON serialization |
| `12-pascal_triangle.py` | Returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal's triangle |

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.8.*)
- All modules, classes and functions should have documentation

## Usage

Example for task 0:
```bash
python3 0-main.py
